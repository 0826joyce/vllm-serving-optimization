        The function selects a running request and iterates through its blocks.
        A block is considered a common prefix block if ALL requests with
        allocated KV cache share it (i.e., ref_cnt equals the number of entries
        in req_to_blocks).

        NOTE(woosuk): The number of requests with allocated KV cache is **greater
        than or equal to** the number of requests scheduled in the current step.
        This is because having allocated KV cache only indicates that:
        1. The request has not yet finished, and
        2. The request holds its blocks unfreed.

        While all scheduled requests must have allocated KV cache, the inverse
        is not necessarily true. There may be requests with allocated KV cache
        that are not scheduled in the current step.

        This can result in an edge case where the number of common prefix blocks
        is 0, even though all scheduled requests share a common prefix. This
        occurs because there may be unscheduled requests that do not share the
        common prefix. Currently, this case cannot be easily detected, so the
